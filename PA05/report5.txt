In project number 5 I first made an array to store all the 0s and 1s to computer the coordinates when ever it equaled 1 i used the variables and x and y. I then stored the start node, then put in the boards, after that I put in the ending board. I put all of these values into an array of nodes. After making an array of nodes, I make an adjancey list. While making the adjancey list I also calculate the weights. After I had the graph made I used Bellman-Fords algorithm to determine the shortest distance. Bellman's Ford's time complexity is approximately O(n^2) where as the space complexity is O(n).
